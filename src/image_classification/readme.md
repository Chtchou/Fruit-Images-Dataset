### Requirements ###

  Make sure you have the latest version of tensorflow installed. Instalation guide [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/).

### Bundle images into tf record files ###

Use the utils/build_image_data.py script to generate the train-00000-of-00001 and validation-00000-of-00001 tfrecords file 
which are needed for the train and test scripts. 

In the build_image_data.py file you can modify the path to the dataset, the location where the tfrecords are saved and 
the path to the labels file. The labels file contains the labels(names of folders) from the dataset that you want to include in the tfrecord files, each label must be on a newline.

Alternatively, the build_image_data.py can be run from the command line like this:

python build_image_data.py \[flags\]

The available options are:

--train_directory=path to the folder containing the train images 

--validation_directory=path to the folder containing the validation images 

--output_directory=path to where to output the tfrecord files 

--labels_file=path to the label file

### Train the network ###

Run the network/fruit_train_net.py to train the network - currently the network runs for 20000 iterations and saves the 
network state every 50 steps. This will generate the fruit_models/ folder where the network parameters and the graph meta data 
are saved.

### Test the network ###

After training the network run the network/fruit_test_net.py to test the obtained model.

### Customization ###

The network_structure/network.py file contains the network definition as well as parameters used for building the network: 

batch_size - amount of images used in each iteration

input_size - amount of pixels in the first layer of the network

num_classes - number of classes on the output layer -> this must match the number of 
classes that is used to generate the tf record from the build_image_data.py script

dropout - probability to keep the weights resulted after a train iteration

initial_learning_rate - start value for the learning rate
final_learning_rate - lower bound for the learning rate

The network_structure/utils.py file contains a few helper methods. The most important ones are:

adjust_image_for_train - performs data augmentation on images by altering the hue 
and saturation and by randomly flipping the image vertically and orizontally; 
this method converts the image to HSV and adds a new layer with the grayscale version of the input image

adjust_image_for_test - converts the image to HSV and adds the grayscale channel
